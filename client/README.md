# Project Name TBD

This project is a React client application built with Vite. Below are the steps to get the client up and running.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)

```

## Getting Started


1. **Navigate to the client directory:**

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name/client
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Make sure all required packages are installed by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the client:**

   Use the following command to start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the application:**

   Open your browser and navigate to:

   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

   This URL may differ if you have configured Vite to run on a different port.


## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the client, try deleting `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then reinstalling dependencies with:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

Happy coding!
